## üéØ Overview

This project contains two different implementations of the classic Blackjack card game:

1. **Basic Implementation** (`main.py`) - A functional, straightforward approach
2. **Advanced Implementation** (`improved_blackjack.py`) - Object-oriented design with advanced features

Both implementations follow the standard Blackjack rules where players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while competing against a computer dealer.

### File Descriptions

- **`main.py`** - Entry point for the basic game with simple, functional programming approach
- **`improved_blackjack.py`** - Advanced implementation showcasing OOP principles and design patterns
- **`art.py`** - Contains ASCII art logo and visual elements for the game

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devdunlap/capstone.git
   cd capstone
   ```

2. **Run the basic game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Run the advanced game:**
   ```bash
   python improved_blackjack.py
   ```

### Optional: Code Quality Tools

Install pylint for code quality checking:
```bash
pip install pylint
```

Run code quality checks:
```bash
pylint main.py
pylint improved_blackjack.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. **Objective:** Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
2. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards (2-10): Face value
   - Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points
   - Aces: 11 points (automatically adjusts to 1 if needed)
3. **Dealer Rules:** Dealer hits on 16 and below, stands on 17 and above

### Game Controls
- **Hit:** Type `h`, `hit`, or `y` to draw another card
- **Stand:** Type `s`, `stand`, or `n` to keep your current hand
- **Play Again:** Type `y` or `yes` to start a new game
- **Quit:** Type `n` or `no` to exit

### Sample Gameplay

```
üé∞‚ú® WELCOME TO BLACKJACK! ‚ú®üé∞

üéÆ Would you like to play Blackjack? (y/n): y

==================================================
üÉè YOUR CARDS: ['A', 'K'] | Score: 21
ü§ñ COMPUTER CARDS: [7, ?] | Score: ?
==================================================

üéâ BLACKJACK! You got 21!
üéâ Blackjack! You win! üéâ
```

## üîß Game Implementations

### Basic Implementation (`main.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Functional programming approach
- Simple card representation using dictionaries
- Global constants and functions
- Enhanced user interface with emojis
- Game statistics tracking

**Code Highlights:**
```python
# Card representation
CARDS = [
    {"name": "A", "value": 11},
    {"name": "K", "value": 10},
    # ... more cards
]

# Core game logic
def calculate_score(hand):
    """Calculates the score of a hand with Ace adjustment."""
    score = sum(card["value"] for card in hand)
    if score > 21 and any(card["name"] == "A" for card in hand):
        score -= 10
    return score
```

### Advanced Implementation (`improved_blackjack.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Object-oriented design with proper encapsulation
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Comprehensive class hierarchy
- Money management system
- Advanced error handling

**Class Structure:**
```python
class Card:          # Individual playing card
class Deck:          # 52-card deck with shuffling
class Hand:          # Collection of cards with scoring
class Player:        # Player with money management
class Dealer:        # Dealer with house rules
class BlackjackGame: # Main game controller
```

## üìä Code Quality

This project maintains high code quality standards:

- ‚úÖ **PEP 8 Compliance** - Follows Python style guidelines
- ‚úÖ **Pylint Score: 10/10** - Passes all linting checks
- ‚úÖ **Type Hints** - Comprehensive type annotations (advanced version)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation** - Detailed docstrings for all functions and classes
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Robust input validation and error management
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns and modular design

### Quality Checks Performed
- Import ordering (standard library first)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper function/class documentation
- Elimination of code smells
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Optimal complexity management

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+** - Core programming language
- **Built-in Libraries:**
  - `random` - Card shuffling and dealing
  - `os` - Cross-platform screen clearing
  - `enum` - Type-safe enumeration for card suits
  - `typing` - Type hints for better code documentation

## üé® Design Patterns

### Basic Implementation
